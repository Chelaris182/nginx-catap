Drop incorrect special case for return 204.

The special case in question leads to replies without body in
configuration like

   location / { error_page 404 /zero; return 404; }
   location /zero { return 204; }

while replies with empty body are expected per protocol specs.

Correct one will look like

   if (status == NGX_HTTP_NO_CONTENT) {

       rc = ngx_http_send_header(r);

       if (rc == NGX_ERROR || r->header_only) {
           return rc;
       }

       return ngx_http_send_special(r, NGX_HTTP_LAST);
   }

though it looks like it's better to drop this special case at all.
