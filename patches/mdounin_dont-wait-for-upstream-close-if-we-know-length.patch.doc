Upstream: don't wait for upstream close if we know length.

This change basically deligates right to control how many bytes may be
buffered by ngx_event_pipe to input filter by means of changing p->length.

Currently p->length is set to NGX_MAX_OFF_T_VALUE if content length isn't
known (and thus input must be terminated by upstream connection close), or
to content length if it's known.

Futher improvement may involve correct parsing of chunked transfer encoding -
by setting p->length in input filter as approprate.  E.g. set it to 2 if you
just parsed chunk end and expect other chunk to start (chunk takes at least
3 bytes, "0" CRLF, but RFC 2616 recomends to be tolerant and recognize bare
LF too).
