Upstream: fix proxy_store leaving temporary files for subrequests.

Temporary files might not be removed if the "proxy_store" or "fastcgi_store"
directives were used for subrequests (e.g. ssi includes) and client closed
prematurely connection.

When client closes connection non-active subrequests are finalized out of
the control of upstream module, and code to remove unfinished temporary files
in ngx_http_upstream_process_request() isn't executed.  This patch moves
relevant code into ngx_http_upstream_finalize_request() function which is
called in all cases (either directly or via cleanup handler installed by
upstream module).
