Variables: honor no_cacheable for not_found variables.

Variables with not_found flag set follow the same rules as ones with valid
flag set.  Make sure ngx_http_get_flushed_variable() will flush non-cacheable
variables with not_found flag set.

This fixes at least one known problem with $args not available in subrequest
(with args) when there were no args in main request and $args variable was
queried in main request (reported by Laurence Rowe aka elro on irc).

Also this eliminates unneeded call to ngx_http_get_indexed_variable() in
cacheable case (as it will return cached value anyway).
