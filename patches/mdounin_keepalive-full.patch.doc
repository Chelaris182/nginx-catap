Hello!

Attached patch (against 1.0.5) introduces upstream keepalive 
support for memcached, fastcgi and http.  Note the patch is 
experimental and may have problems (though it passes basic smoke 
tests here).  Testing is appreciated.

Major changes include:

1. Content length now parsed into u->headers_in.content_length_n
   instead of directly to r->headers_out.content_length_n.
   Note this may break 3rd party protocol modules.

2. Use off_t for r->upstream->length.
   Note this may break 3rd party protocol modules.

3. In buffered mode u->pipe->length was introduced to indicate minimal amount
   of data which must be passed to input filter.  This allows to not rely on
   connection close to indicate response end while still effectiently using
   buffers in most cases.  Defaults to -1 (that is, wait for
   connection close) if not set by protocol-specific handlers.

4. In buffered mode u->input_filter_init() now called if it's set.
   This is used to set initial value of u->pipe->length (see above).

5. Proxy module now able to talk HTTP/1.1, in particular it understands
   chunked encoding in responses.  Requests are sent using HTTP/1.1
   if proxy_http_version directive is set to 1.1.

6. Introduced u->keepalive flag to indicate connection to upstream is in
   correct state and may be kept alive.  Memcached, fastcgi and proxy
   modules are updated to set it.

Patch is expected to be used with upstream keepalive module[1] compiled with
NGX_UPSTREAM_KEEPALIVE_PATCHED defined, i.e use something like this:

    ./configure --with-cc-opt="-D NGX_UPSTREAM_KEEPALIVE_PATCHED" \
        --add-module=/path/to/ngx_http_upstream_keepalive

And use something like this in config:

    upstream memcached_backend {
        server 127.0.0.1:11211;
        keepalive 1;
    }

    upstream http_backend {
        server 127.0.0.1:8080;
        keepalive 1;
    }

    upstream fastcgi_backend {
        server 127.0.0.1:9000;
        keepalive 1;
    }

    server {
        ...

        location /memcached/ {
            set $memcached_key $uri;
            memcached_pass memcached_backend;
        }

        location /fastcgi/ {
            fastcgi_pass fastcgi_backend;
            ...
        }

        location /http/ {
            proxy_pass http://http_backend;
            proxy_http_version 1.1;
            proxy_set_header Connection "";
            ...
        }
    }
