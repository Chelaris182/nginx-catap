Gzip filter: handle empty flush buffers.

Empty flush buffers are legitimate and may happen e.g. due to $r->flush()
calls in embedded perl.  If there are no data buffered in zlib deflate()
will return Z_BUF_ERROR (i.e. no progress possible) without adding anything
to output.  Don't treat Z_BUF_ERROR as fatal and correctly send empty flush
buffer if we have no data in output at all.
