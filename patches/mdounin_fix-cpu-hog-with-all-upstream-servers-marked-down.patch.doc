Fix cpu hog with all upstream servers marked "down".

The following configuration causes nginx to hog cpu due to infinite loop
in ngx_http_upstream_get_peer():

   upstream backend {
       server 127.0.0.1:8080 down;
       server 127.0.0.1:8080 down;
   }

   server {
      ...
      location / {
          proxy_pass http://backend;
      }
   }

Make sure we don't loop infinitely in ngx_http_upstream_get_peer() but stop
after resetting peer weights once.

Return 0 if we are stuck.  This is guaranteed to work as peer 0 always exists,
and eventually ngx_http_upstream_get_round_robin_peer() will do the right
thing falling back to backup servers or returning NGX_BUSY.
