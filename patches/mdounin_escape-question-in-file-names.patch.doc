Autoindex: escape '?' in file names.

For files with '?' in their names autoindex generated links with '?' not
escaped.  This resulted in effectively truncated links as '?' indicates
query string start.

This is updated version of the patch originally posted at [1].  It introduces
generic NGX_ESCAPE_URI_COMPONENT which escapes everything but unreseved
characters as per RFC 3986.  This aproach also renders unneeded special colon
processing (as colon is percent-encoded now), it's dropped accordingly.
