Complain on invalid log levels.

Previously only first log level were required to be correct, while error_log
directive in fact accepts list of levels (e.g. one may specify "error_log ...
debug_core debug_http;").  This resulted in (avoidable) wierd behaviour on
missing semicolon after error_log directive, e.g.

error_log /path/to/log info
index index.php;

silently skipped index directive and it's arguments (trying to interpret
them as log levels without checking to be correct).
