Cache: fix another "stalled cache updating" alert.

The one reported at [1] happens if client closes prematurely connection
before response header was got from upstream and response isn't cacheable.

As such situations are expected to happen on other errors too, teach
ngx_http_upstream_finalize_request() to free cache in such situations.
This is consistent with behaviour for cacheable responses.
