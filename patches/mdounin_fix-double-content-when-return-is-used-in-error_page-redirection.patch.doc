Fix double content when return is used in error_page redirection.

Test case:

  location / {
      error_page 405 /nope;
      return 405;
  }

  location /nope {
      return 200;
  }

This is expected to return 405 with empty body, but in 0.8.42+ will return
builtin 405 error page as well (though not counted in Content-Length, thus
breaking protocol).

Note that this patch also changes behaviour for "return 302 ..." and
"rewrite ... redirect" used as error handler.  E.g.

   location / {
       error_page 405 /redirect;
       return 405;
   }

   location /redirect {
       rewrite ^ http://example.com/;
   }

will actually return redirect to "http://example.com/" instead of builtin 405
error page with meaningless Location header.  This looks like correct change
and it's in line with what happens on e.g. directory redirects in error
handlers.
