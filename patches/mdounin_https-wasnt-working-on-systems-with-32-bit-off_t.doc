Bugfix: https wasn't working on systems with 32-bit off_t.

Due to off_t being signed NGX_MAX_UINT32_VALUE will overflow off_t while
calculating limit in ngx_ssl_send_chain() on systems with 32-bit off_t,
and as a result ngx_ssl_send_chain() won't be able to send anything.

Introduce NGX_MAX_INT32_VALUE and use it there instead.
