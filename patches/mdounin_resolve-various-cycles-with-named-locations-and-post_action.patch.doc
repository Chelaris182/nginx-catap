Core: resolve various cycles with named locations and post_action.

Now redirects to named locations are counted against normal uri changes
limit, and post_action respect this limit as well.  As a result at least the
following (bad) configurations no longer trigger infinite cycle:

1. Post action which recursively triggers post action:

   location / {
       post_action /index.html;
   }

2. Post action pointing to nonexistent named location:

   location / {
       post_action @nonexistent;
   }

3. Recursive error page for 500 (Internal Server Error) pointing to
nonexistent named location:

   location / {
       recursive_error_pages on;
       error_page 500 @nonexistent;
       return 500;
   }
